# Netflix_Recommendation_System
implemented a netflix movies recommendation system using Python

Business Problem : 
Netflix wants to make their movie recommendations even better. Their current 
system, Cinematch, does a good job of suggesting movies based on what 
people liked before. But Netflix thinks they can do even better. They want to 
explore new ways of recommending movies that might work even more 
accurately than Cinematch. By finding a better approach, Netflix hopes to 
make a big difference for their customers and their business.

Problem Statement: 
The objective of this project is to develop a Netflix movie 
recommendation system that offers personalized movie suggestions to 
users based on their preferences or specific keywords. The system 
aims to enhance the user experience by providing tailored 
recommendations that align with individual tastes and interests. 

Abstract: 
This project aims to develop a Netflix recommendation system using 
Python. The system suggests movies similar to the user's favorite 
movie. We utilize techniques like text processing and cosine similarity 
to determine the similarity between movies based on their 
descriptions. The project involves data manipulation, visualization, 
and machine learning algorithms for building the recommendation 
model.

Introduction:
With the vast library of movies available on Netflix, users often face 
the challenge of finding content that matches their preferences. To 
address this issue, we propose a recommendation system that 
suggests movies similar to the user's favorite. Leveraging techniques 
from natural language processing and machine learning, our system 
analyzes movie descriptions to identify similarities and provide 
personalized recommendations. This documentation outlines the 
process of building and implementing the Netflix recommendation 
system. 

Literature Survey: 
Various recommendation systems exist in the literature, including 
collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models. 
Content-based filtering, which focuses on the attributes of items and 
users' preferences, is particularly relevant to our project. Techniques 
such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and 
cosine similarity have been widely used in content-based 
recommendation systems. We draw upon these methodologies to 
develop our Netflix recommendation system.

Model :

-TF-IDF Vectorization: 
TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. 
It's a numerical statistic that is intended to reflect how important a 
word is to a document in a collection or corpus. 
It's used to convert textual data into numerical data for machine 
learning algorithms. 
You've used TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn to transform textual data 
(movie descriptions) into TF-IDF feature vectors. 

-Cosine Similarity: 
after transforming the textual data into TF-IDF vectors, you calculate 
the similarity between movies based on these vectors. 
Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two 
documents are, irrespective of their size. 
It computes the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in 
a multi-dimensional space. 
Higher cosine similarity indicates that the two vectors (movies, in this 
case) are more similar. 
You've used cosine_similarity from scikit-learn to compute the cosine 
similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of movies 

-String Matching: 
You've used difflib.get_close_matches() to find the closest matching 
movie title in case the exact title is not found. 
This allows for a certain degree of fuzziness in the user input, which is 
helpful for handling typos or slight variations in movie titles. 

Methodology : 

-Data Preprocessing: 
We begin by loading the dataset containing information about 
Netflix movies. We select relevant features such as title, director, 
cast, country, release year, rating, description, and duration. 
Additionally, we assign an index to each movie for efficient 
retrieval. 

-Text Processing:
We preprocess the movie descriptions by removing 
punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing the 
words. We also perform stemming or lemmatization to reduce 
words to their root form. 

-TF-IDF Vectorization: 
Using the TF-IDF vectorizer, we convert the preprocessed text 
data into numerical vectors, where each dimension represents 
the importance of a word in the document. 

-Cosine Similarity Calculation: 
We compute the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of 
movies to measure their similarity. This similarity score indicates 
how closely related two movies are based on their descriptions. 
ïƒ˜ Recommendation Generation: 
Given a user's favorite movie, we find the closest match in the 
dataset and retrieve movies with the highest cosine similarity 
scores. These recommended movies are then presented to the 
user.

Result: 
The recommendation system successfully suggests movies similar to 
the user's favorite, based on their descriptions. The ranked list 
provides users with personalized recommendations tailored to their 
preferences.
